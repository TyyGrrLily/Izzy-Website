        <h2>Software Engineer Extraordinaire</h2>
        <>
          As a software engineer, I am driven by creativity and collaboration,
          seeking challenging opportunities to thrive within community-focused
          teams. Outside of work, I immerse myself in personal art projects,
          sourdough baking, and engaging board games with friends. Continuously
          developing my skills in both programming and art, I find joy in
          creating new thingsâ€”from implementing innovative forms to exploring
          diverse mediums like ceramics. My primary goal is growth, both
          personally and professionally.
